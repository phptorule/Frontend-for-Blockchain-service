          <p>We at Jerusalem Chain believe your privacy is highly important, and we have written this privacy policy (this “Policy”) to reflect our values, and to clearly describe what information we collect from you when you use our specially-developed smart contracts to enable users to buy and transfer digital pieces of Jerusalem Chain, which can then be visualized on the website (https://jerusalemchain.com) that users can interact with (the “Site”), as well as how we protect and use that information. The smart contracts and the Site are collectively referred to in this Policy as the “App”. By using the App, you agree that we can collect, use, disclose, and process your information as described in this Policy. This Policy only applies to the App, and not to any other websites, products or services you may be able to access or link to via the App. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any other websites you visit before providing your information to them.</p>

          <p>While our values will not shift, the App will evolve over time, and this Policy will change to reflect that evolution. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Policy. In some cases, if we make significant changes, we may give you additional notice by adding a statement to our homepage, or by sending you an email notification. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically to stay informed about our practices.</p>
          <h2>Information Collection</h2>

          <h3>Information We Do Collect</h3>

          <p>We will ask you to provide us with your name, email address, and your e-wallet address. We will not store your digital signature data, only the checksum of your signature. Optionally you can provide us with your photograph (avatar) – for displaying it within the app and your postal address for delivery of the printed Certificate.</p>

          <p>We also collect basic analytics and log-in information when you use the App. This sort of information may be collected from third-party providers like Facebook or Google Analytics, and includes, among other things, the type of device you use, access times, IP address, hardware model, operating system and version, and other unique device identifiers. Some of these third-party providers may place cookies or pixels - small data files stored on your hard drive or in device memory - on your browser or hard drive. Note that this Policy does not cover the use of cookies or pixels by such third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies and pixels by default, but you can usually set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies or pixels. If you do choose to remove or reject cookies or pixels, however, your ability to use the App might be affected.</p>

          <h3>Information We Don’t Collect</h3>

          <p>We do not collect any other personally-identifiable information about you, unless you give it to us directly: by filling out a form, creating an account, giving us written feedback, communicating with us via third party social media sites, or otherwise communicating with us via the App or any other means. We do not collect any payment information from you, other than your Ethereum wallet address.</p>

          <h2>Information Usage</h2>

          <h3>What We Do With Information We Collect</h3>

          <p>We use the information we collect in the following ways:</p>

          <p>To analyze trends for how the App is being used;</p>
          <p>To improve the App;</p>
          <p>To help personalize your experience of the App; and If you gave us your contact information, we will use it to send you data as part of making the App available to you. We may also use that information to contact you to send you technical notices, updates, confirmations, security alerts, to provide support to you, to tell you about other products and services that we think might interest you, or to respond to your comments or questions.</p>

          <p>We may share the information we collect with third parties who need to access it in order to do work on our behalf, including doing things like helping us make the App available,  providing analytics services for us, or postal/parcel services in order to deliver you packages. We work hard to ensure that these third parties only access and use your information as necessary to perform their functions.</p>

          <p>We will create aggregations and anonymizations that contain your information in a way that does not directly identify you. We may use and/or share those aggregations and anonymizations for a variety of purposes related to the App, or our company and its business.</p>

          <h3>What We Don’t Do With Information We Collect</h3>

          <p>We do not share any information that directly identifies you with any third party, except in the following limited cases:</p>
